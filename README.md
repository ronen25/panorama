## What is it?
Panorama is a very simple Linux system monitor written in C++ using the ImGui UI toolkit. It's meant to show that writing beautiful and functional tools using IMGui is quite easy.

## Supported Platforms
Currently the tool was tested on KDE Neon, Ubuntu 16.04 - 22.04, and Fedora 27-34 with the AMD64 and x86 variants.

Any video driver that has support for OpenGL 2.1 will suffice. Tested with AMD, Intel, NVIDIA and Virtualbox drivers.

## Installation

### Snap Packages (Recommended)
Snap builds are automatically built with every commit to this repo.

You can install them directly from the snap store:

```
$ sudo snap install panorama
```

### Compiling from Source
Please refer to [this](https://github.com/ronen25/panorama/wiki/Compiling-from-Source) wiki page.

# FAQ
1 *I have a HiDPI screen and Panorama's font looks small :-(*

Set the `PANORAMA_SCALING` environment variable to 2.0 or above.
This will also scale other UI elements.

2 *When Panorama opens, all I get is a black window...*

Panorama uses ImGui which uses OpenGL 2.1 (through SDL2) to render the window.
Make sure you have the latest video drivers!

# TODO
At first I intended Panorama to be a cross-platform system monitor. Because of time constrains I could not complete
the cross-platform support, so I only coded the Linux support.

Also, need to replace the concurrent scheduling bit with a single worker
thread with a work queue of some sort, which'll work better than the whole ```future``` stuff done here.
